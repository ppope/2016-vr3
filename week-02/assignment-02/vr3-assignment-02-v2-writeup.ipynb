    "On the five stock portfolio\\footnote{consisting of Apple, Bank Of America, GE, Exxon, and Walmart}, we report both absolute and relative measures of annual return and associated risk since the initial time of investment. For the relative measures, we build a linear model to correlate the portfolio's daily returns with those of the S&P. For a measure of absolute return, we compute the average percent difference between each stock's value on the first data point of the year and the last. For a measure of absolute risk, we compute the standard deviation of the daily returns. Data was obtained from Yahoo Finance. Precise details are given below.\n",

An alpha value equal to zero indicates the portfolio performed  to market expectation. Postive values of alpha performance greater than the market expectation. Beta is a measure of relative risk with respect to the market. A beta value equal to 1 indicates that the portfolio fluctuates as the market does. A beta value less than one indicates less fluctuation than the market, and greater than one indicates more so. Additionally we report the Pearson correlation coefficient $R^2$ for the model.
